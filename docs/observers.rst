Observing an Experiment
***********************
When you run an experiment you want to keep track of enough information,
such that you can analyse the results, and reproduce them if needed.
Sacred helps you doing that by providing an *Observer Interface* for your
experiments. By attaching an Observer you can gather all the information about
the run even while it is still running.
Observers have a ``priority`` attribute, and are run in order of descending
priority. The first observer determines the ``_id`` of the run.


At the moment there are five observers that are shipped with Sacred:

 * The main one is the :ref:`mongo_observer` which stores all information in a
   `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org/>`_.
 * The :ref:`file_observer` stores the run information as files in a given
   directory and will therefore only work locally.
 * The :ref:`tinydb_observer` provides another local way of observing experiments
   by using `tinydb <http://tinydb.readthedocs.io>`_
   to store run information in a JSON file. 
 * The :ref:`sql_observer` connects to any SQL database and will store the
   relevant information there.
 * The :ref:`s3_observer` stores run information in an AWS S3 bucket, within
   a given prefix/directory


But if you want the run information stored some other way, it is easy to write
your own :ref:`custom_observer`.

.. _mongo_observer:

Mongo Observer
==============

.. note::
    Requires the `pymongo <https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/>`_ package.
    Install with ``pip install pymongo``.

The MongoObserver is the recommended way of storing the run information from
Sacred.
MongoDB allows very powerful querying of the entries that can deal with
almost any structure of the configuration and the custom info.
Furthermore it is easy to set-up and allows to connect to a central remote DB.
Most tools for further analysing the data collected by Sacred build upon this
observer.

Adding a MongoObserver
----------------------
You can add a MongoObserver from the command-line via the ``-m MY_DB`` flag::

    >> ./my_experiment.py -m MY_DB

Here ``MY_DB`` is just the name of the database inside MongoDB that you want
the information to be stored in.
To make MongoObserver work with remote MongoDBs you have to pass a URL with a
port::

    >> ./my_experiment.py -m HOST:PORT:MY_DB
    >> ./my_experiment.py -m 192.168.1.1:27017:MY_DB
    >> ./my_experiment.py -m my.server.org:12345:MY_DB

You can also add it from code like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import MongoObserver

    ex.observers.append(MongoObserver())



Or with server and port:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import MongoObserver

    ex.observers.append(MongoObserver(url='my.server.org:27017',
                                      db_name='MY_DB'))

This assumes you either have a local MongoDB running or have access to it over
network without authentication.
(See `here <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/>`_ on how to install)

You can setup MongoDB easily with Docker. See the instructions
in  :ref:`docker_setup` .

Authentication
--------------
If you need authentication a little more work might be necessary.
First you have to decide which
`authentication protocol <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/examples/authentication.html>`_
you want to use. If it can be done by just using the ``MongoDB URI`` then just pass that, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import MongoObserver

    ex.observers.append(MongoObserver(
        url='mongodb://user:password@example.com/the_database?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1',
        db_name='MY_DB'))


If additional arguments need to be passed to the MongoClient they can just be included:


.. code-block:: python

    ex.observers.append(MongoObserver(
        url="mongodb://<X.509 derived username>@example.com/?authMechanism=MONGODB-X509",
        db_name='MY_DB',
        ssl=True,
        ssl_certfile='/path/to/client.pem',
        ssl_cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
        ssl_ca_certs='/path/to/ca.pem'))

Database Entry
--------------
The MongoObserver creates three collections to store information. The first,
``runs`` (that name can be changed), is the main collection that contains one
entry for each run.
The other two (``fs.files``, ``fs.chunks``) are used to store associated files
in the database (compare `GridFS <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/gridfs/>`_).

.. note::
    This is the new database layout introduced in version 0.7.0.
    Before that there was a common prefix `default` for all collections.

So here is an example entry in the ``runs`` collection::

    > db.runs.find()[0]
    {
        "_id" : ObjectId("5507248a1239672ae04591e2"),
        "format" : "MongoObserver-0.7.0",
        "status" : "COMPLETED",
        "result" : null,
        "start_time" : ISODate("2016-07-11T14:50:14.473Z"),
        "heartbeat" : ISODate("2015-03-16T19:44:26.530Z"),
        "stop_time" : ISODate("2015-03-16T19:44:26.532Z"),
        "config" : {
            "message" : "Hello world!",
            "seed" : 909032414,
            "recipient" : "world"
        },
        "info" : { },
        "resources" : [ ],
        "artifacts" : [ ],
        "captured_out" : "Hello world!\n",
        "experiment" : {
            "name" : "hello_cs",
            "base_dir" : "$(HOME)/sacred/examples/"
            "dependencies" : ["numpy==1.9.1", "sacred==0.7.0"],
            "sources" : [
                [
                    "03_hello_config_scope.py",
                    ObjectId("5507248a1239672ae04591e3")
                ]
            ],
            "repositories" : [{
                "url" : "git@github.com:IDSIA/sacred.git"
				"dirty" : false,
				"commit" : "d88deb2555bb311eb779f81f22fe16dd3b703527"}]
        },
        "host" : {
            "os" : ["Linux",
                    "Linux-3.13.0-46-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-14.04-trusty"],
            "cpu" : "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz",
            "hostname" : "MyAwesomeMachine",
            "python_version" : "3.4.0"
        },
    }

As you can see a lot of relevant information is being stored, among it the
used configuration, automatically detected package dependencies and information
about the host.

If we take a look at the ``fs.files`` collection we can also see, that
it stored the sourcecode of the experiment in the database::

    > db.fs.files.find()[0]
    {
        "_id" : ObjectId("5507248a1239672ae04591e3"),
        "filename" : "$(HOME)/sacred/examples/03_hello_config_scope.py",
        "md5" : "897b2144880e2ee8e34775929943f496",
        "chunkSize" : 261120,
        "length" : 1526,
        "uploadDate" : ISODate("2016-07-11T12:50:14.522Z")
    }


.. _file_observer:

File Storage Observer
=====================
The FileStorageObserver is the most basic observer and requires the least
amount of setup.
It is mostly meant for preliminary experiments and cases when setting up a
database is difficult or impossible.
But in combination with the template rendering integration it can be very
helpful.

Adding a FileStorageObserver
----------------------------
The FileStorageObserver can be added from the command-line via the
``-F BASEDIR`` and  ``--file_storage=BASEDIR`` flags::

    >> ./my_experiment.py -F BASEDIR
    >> ./my_experiment.py --file_storage=BASEDIR

Here ``BASEDIR`` is the name of the directory in which all the subdirectories
for individual runs will be created.

You can, of course, also add it from code like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import FileStorageObserver

    ex.observers.append(FileStorageObserver('my_runs'))


Directory Structure
-------------------
The FileStorageObserver creates a separate sub-directory for each run and stores
several files in there::

    my_runs/
        run_3mdq4amp/
            config.json
            cout.txt
            info.json
            run.json
        run_zw82a7xg/
            ...
        ...

``config.json`` contains the JSON-serialized version of the configuration
and ``cout.txt`` the captured output.
The main information is stored in ``run.json`` and is very similar to the
database entries from the :ref:`mongo_observer`::

    {
      "command": "main",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "start_time": "2016-07-11T15:35:14.765152",
      "heartbeat": "2016-07-11T15:35:14.766793",
      "stop_time": "2016-07-11T15:35:14.768465",
      "result": null,
      "experiment": {
        "base_dir": "/home/greff/Programming/sacred/examples",
        "dependencies": [
          "numpy==1.11.0",
          "sacred==0.6.9"],
        "name": "hello_cs",
        "repositories": [{
            "commit": "d88deb2555bb311eb779f81f22fe16dd3b703527",
            "dirty": false,
            "url": "git@github.com:IDSIA/sacred.git"}],
        "sources": [
          ["03_hello_config_scope.py",
           "_sources/03_hello_config_scope_897b2144880e2ee8e34775929943f496.py"]]
      },
      "host": {
        "cpu": "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz",
        "hostname": "Liz",
        "os": ["Linux",
               "Linux-3.19.0-58-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-15.04-vivid"],
        "python_version": "3.4.3"
      },
      "artifacts": [],
      "resources": [],
      "meta": {},
    }

In addition to that there is an ``info.json`` file holding :ref:`custom_info`
(if existing) and all the :ref:`artifacts`.

The FileStorageObserver also stores a snapshot of the source-code in a separate
``my_runs/_sources`` directory, and :ref:`resources` in ``my_runs/_resources``
(if present).
Their filenames are stored in the ``run.json`` file such that the corresponding
files can be easily linked to their respective run.

Template Rendering
------------------
In addition to these basic files, the FileStorageObserver can also generate a
report for each run from a given template file.
The prerequisite for this is that the `mako <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_ package is installed and a
``my_runs/template.html`` file needs to exist.
The file can be located somewhere else, but then the filename must be passed to
the FileStorageObserver like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import FileStorageObserver

    ex.observers.append(FileStorageObserver('my_runs', template='/custom/template.txt'))

The FileStorageObserver will then render that template into a
``report.html``/``report.txt`` file in the respective run directory.
``mako`` is a very powerful templating engine that can execute
arbitrary python-code, so be careful about the templates you use.
For an example see ``sacred/examples/my_runs/template.html``.

.. _tinydb_observer:

TinyDB Observer
===============
.. note::
    requires the
    `tinydb <http://tinydb.readthedocs.io>`_,
    `tinydb-serialization <https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb-serialization>`_,
    and `hashfs <https://github.com/dgilland/hashfs>`_ packages installed.

The TinyDbObserver uses the `tinydb <http://tinydb.readthedocs.io>`_
library to provides an alternative to storing results in MongoDB whilst still 
allowing results to be stored in a document like database. This observer 
uses TinyDB to store the metadata about an observed run in a JSON file. 

The TinyDbObserver also makes use of the hashfs `hashfs <https://github.com/dgilland/hashfs>`_
library to store artifacts, resources and source code files associated with a run. 
Storing results like this provides an easy way to lookup associated files for a run
bases on their hash, and ensures no duplicate files are stored. 

The main drawback of storing files in this way is that they are not easy to manually 
inspect, as their path names are now the hash of their content. Therefore, to aid in
retrieving data and files stored by the TinyDbObserver, a TinyDbReader class is 
provided to allow for easier querying and retrieval of the results. This ability to
store metadata and files in a way that can be queried locally is the main advantage
of the TinyDbObserver observer compared to the FileStorageObserver.  

The TinyDbObserver is designed to be a simple, scalable way to store and query 
results as a single user on a local file system, either for personal experimentation
or when setting up a larger database configuration is not desirable.  

Adding a TinyDbObserver
-----------------------
The TinyDbObserver can be added from the command-line via the
``-t BASEDIR`` and  ``--tiny_db=BASEDIR`` flags::

    >> ./my_experiment.py -t BASEDIR
    >> ./my_experiment.py --tiny_db=BASEDIR

Here ``BASEDIR`` specifies the directory in which the TinyDB JSON file and 
hashfs filesytem will be created. All intermediate directories are created with
the default being to create a directory called ``runs_db`` in the current 
directory. 

Alternatively, you can also add the observer from code like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import TinyDbObserver

    ex.observers.append(TinyDbObserver('my_runs'))

    # You can also create this observer from a HashFS and
    # TinyDB object directly with:
    ex.observers.append(TinyDbObserver.create_from(my_db, my_fs))


Directory Structure
-------------------
The TinyDbObserver creates a directory structure as follows::

    my_runs/
        metadata.json
        hashfs/

``metadata.json`` contains the JSON-serialized metadata in the TinyDB format.  
Each entry is very similar to the database entries from the :ref:`mongo_observer`::

    {
      "_id": "2118c70ef274497f90b7eb72dcf34598",
      "artifacts": [],
      "captured_out": "",
      "command": "run",
      "config": {
        "C": 1,
        "gamma": 0.7,
        "seed": 191164913
      },
      "experiment": {
        "base_dir": "/Users/chris/Dropbox/projects/dev/sacred-tinydb",
        "dependencies": [
          "IPython==5.1.0",
          "numpy==1.11.2",
          "sacred==0.7b0",
          "sklearn==0.18"
        ],
        "name": "iris_rbf_svm",
        "repositories": [],
        "sources": [
          [
            "test_exp.py",
            "6f4294124f7697655f9fd1f7d4e7798b",
            "{TinyFile}:\"6f4294124f7697655f9fd1f7d4e7798b\""
          ]
        ]
      },
      "format": "TinyDbObserver-0.7b0",
      "heartbeat": "{TinyDate}:2016-11-12T01:18:00.228352",
      "host": {
        "cpu": "Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     P8600  @ 2.40GHz",
        "hostname": "phoebe",
        "os": [
          "Darwin",
          "Darwin-15.5.0-x86_64-i386-64bit"
        ],
        "python_version": "3.5.2"
      },
      "info": {},
      "meta": {},
      "resources": [],
      "result": 0.9833333333333333,
      "start_time": "{TinyDate}:2016-11-12T01:18:00.197311",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "stop_time": "{TinyDate}:2016-11-12T01:18:00.337519"
    }

The elements in the above example are taken from a generated JSON file, where
those prefixed with ``{TinyData}`` will be converted into python datetime
objects upon reading them back in. Likewise those prefixed with ``{TinyFile}``
will be converted into a file object opened in read mode for the associated 
source, artifact or resource file. 

The files referenced in either the sources, artifacts or resources sections 
are stored in a location according to the hash of their contents under the 
``hashfs/`` directory. The hashed file system is setup to create three 
directories from the first 6 characters of the hash, with the rest of
the hash making up the file name. The stored source file is therefore 
located at ::

    my_runs/
        metadata.json
        hashfs/
            59/
                ab/
                    16/
                        5b3579a1869399b4838be2a125

A file handle, serialised with the tag ``{TinyFile}`` in the JSON file, is 
included in the metadata alongside individual source files, artifacts or 
resources as a convenient way to access the file content. 

The TinyDB Reader
-----------------

To make querying and stored results easier, a TinyDbReader class is provided. 
Create a class instance by passing the path to the root directory of the 
TinyDbObserver.  

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import TinyDbReader

    reader = TinyDbReader('my_runs')

The TinyDbReader class provides three main methods for retrieving data: 

* ``.fetch_metadata()`` will return all metadata associated with an experiment. 
* ``.fetch_files()`` will return a dictionary of file handles for the sources, 
  artifacts and resources.
* ``.fetch_report()`` will will return all metadata rendered in a summary report. 

All three provide a similar API, allowing the search for records by index, 
by experiment name, or by using a TinyDB search query.
To do so specify one of the following arguments to the above methods: 

* ``indices`` accepts either a single integer or a list of integers and works like
  list indexing, retrieving experiments in the order they were run. e.g. 
  ``indices=0`` will get the first or oldest experiment, and ``indices=-1`` will 
  get the latest experiment to run. 
* ``exp_name`` accepts a string and retrieves any experiment that contains that
  string in its name. Also works with regular expressions. 
* ``query`` accepts a TinyDB query object and returns all experiments that match it. 
  Refer to the `TinyDB documentation <http://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ 
  for details on the API.  
  

Retrieving Files 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get the files from the last experimental run:

.. code-block:: python

    results = reader.fetch_files(indices=-1)

The results object is a list of dictionaries, each containing the date the experiment 
started, the experiment id, the experiment name, as well as nested dictionaries for 
the sources, artifacts and resources if they are present for the experiment. For each 
of these nested dictionaries, the key is the file name, and the value is a file handle
opened for reading that file. ::

    [{'date': datetime.datetime(2016, 11, 12, 1, 36, 54, 970229),
      'exp_id': '68b71b5c009e4f6a887479cdda7a93a0',
      'exp_name': 'iris_rbf_svm',
      'sources': {'test_exp.py': <BufferedReaderWrapper name='...'>}}]

Individual files can therefore be accessed with, 

.. code-block:: python

    results = reader.fetch_files(indices=-1)
    f = results[0]['sources']['test_exp.py']
    f.read()

Depending on whether the file contents is text or binary data, it can then either be 
printed to console or visualised in an appropriate library e.g. 
`Pillow <https://python-pillow.org/>`_ for images. The content can also be written 
back out to disk and inspected in an external program. 


Summary Report 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often you may want to see a high level summary of an experimental run,
such as the config used the results, and any inputs, dependencies and other artifacts
generated. The ``.fetch_report()`` method is designed to provide these rendered as a 
simple text based report.

To get the report for the last experiment simple run,

.. code-block:: python

    results = reader.fetch_report(indices=-1)
    print(results[0])

:: 

    -------------------------------------------------

.. _sql_observer:

SQL Observer
============
The SqlObserver saves all the relevant information in a set of SQL tables.
It requires the `sqlalchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ package to be
installed.

Adding a SqlObserver
--------------------
The SqlObserver can be added from the command-line via the
``-s DB_URL`` and  ``--sql=DB_URL`` flags::

    >> ./my_experiment.py -s DB_URL
    >> ./my_experiment.py --sql=DB_URL

Here ``DB_URL`` is a url specifying the dialect and server of the SQL database
to connect to. For example:

  * PostgreSQL: ``postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase``
  * MySQL: ``mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/foo``
  * SqlLite: ``sqlite:///foo.db``

For more information on the database-urls see the sqlalchemy `documentation <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls>`_.

To add a SqlObserver from python code do:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import SqlObserver

    ex.observers.append(SqlObserver('sqlite:///foo.db'))

    # It's also possible to instantiate a SqlObserver with an existing
    # engine and session with:
    ex.observers.append(SqlObserver.create_from(my_engine, my_session))


Schema
------
.. image:: images/sql_schema.png


.. _s3_observer:

S3 Observer
============
The S3Observer stores run information in a designated prefix location within a S3 bucket, either by
using an existing bucket, or creating a new one. Using the S3Observer requires that boto3 be
installed, and also that an AWS config file is created with a user's Access Key and Secret Key.
An easy way to do this is by installing AWS command line tools (``pip install awscli``) and
running ``aws configure``.

Adding a S3Observer
--------------------

To create an S3Observer in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import S3Observer
    ex.observers.append(S3Observer(bucket='my-awesome-bucket',
                                   basedir='/my-project/my-cool-experiment/'))

By default, an S3Observer will use the region that is set in your AWS config file, but if you'd
prefer to pass in a specific region, you can use the ``region`` parameter of create to do so.
If you try to create an S3Observer without this parameter, and with region not set in your config
file, it will error out at the point of the observer object being created.

Directory Structure
--------------------

S3Observers follow the same conventions as FileStorageObservers when it comes to directory
structure within a S3 bucket: within ``s3://<bucket>/basedir/`` numeric run directories will be
created in ascending order, and each run directory will contain the files specified within the
FileStorageObserver Directory Structure documentation above.


Slack Observer
==============

The :py:class:`~sacred.observers.slack.SlackObserver` sends a message to
`Slack <https://slack.com/>`_ using an
`incoming webhook <https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks>`_ everytime an
experiment stops:

.. image:: images/slack_observer.png

It requires the `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org>`_ package to be
installed and the ``webhook_url`` of the incoming webhook configured in Slack.
This url is something you shouldn't share with others, so the recommended way
of adding a SlackObserver is from a configuration file:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import SlackObserver

    slack_obs = SlackObserver.from_config('slack.json')
    ex.observers.append(slack_obs)

Where ``slack.json`` at least specifies the ``webhook_url``::

    # Content of file 'slack.json':
    {
        "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }

But it can optionally also customize the other attributes::

    # Content of file 'slack.json':
    {
        "webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "icon": ":imp:",
        "bot_name": "my-sacred-bot",
        "completed_text": "YAY! {ex_info[name] completed with result=`{result}`",
        "interrupted_text": null,
        "failed_text": "Oh noes! {ex_info[name] failed saying `{error}`"
    }


Telegram Observer
=================

The :py:class:`~sacred.observers.slack.TelegramObserver` sends status updates to
`Telegram <https://telegram.org/>`_ using their
`Python Telegram Bot API <https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot>`_ which
obviously has to be installed to use this observer.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade python-telegram-bot


Before using this observer, three steps need to be taken:

  * `Create the bot with @BotFather <https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather>`
  * Write **to** the newly-created bot, since only users can initiate conversations with telegram bots.
  * Retrieve the ``chat_id`` for the chat the bot will send updates to.

The last step can be accomplished using the following script:

.. code-block:: python

    import  telegram

    TOKEN = 'token obtained from @BotFather'

    bot = telegram.Bot(TOKEN)
    for u in bot.get_updates():
        print('{}: [{}] {}'.format(u.message.date, u.message.chat_id, u.message.text))

As with the :py:class:`~sacred.observers.slack.SlackObserver`, the
:py:class:`~sacred.observers.slack.TelegramObserver` needs to be provided with a json, yaml
or pickle file containing...

  * ``token``: the HTTP API token acquired while
  * ``chat_id``: the ID (not username) of the chat to write the updates to.
    This can be a user or a group chat ID
  * optionally: a boolean for ``silent_completion``. If set to true, regular experiment completions
    will use no or less intrusive notifications, depending on the receiving device's platform.
    Experiment starts will always be sent silently, interruptions and failures always with full notifications.
  * optionally: a string for ``proxy_url``. Specify this field, if Telegram is blocked in the local network or
    in the country, and you want to use proxy server.
    Format: ``PROTOCOL://PROXY_HOST:[PROXY_PORT]/``. Socks5 and HTTP protocols are supported.
    These settings also could be received from ``HTTPS_PROXY`` or ``https_proxy`` environment variable.
  * optionally: ``username`` for proxy.
  * optionally: ``password`` for proxy.

The observer is then added to the experment like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observers import TelegramObserver

    telegram_obs = TelegramObserver.from_config('telegram.json')
    ex.observers.append(telegram_obs)


To set the bot's profile photo and description, use @BotFather's commands ``/setuserpic`` and ``/setdescription``.
Note that ``/setuserpic`` requires a *minimum* picture size.

Neptune Observer
================
Neptune observer sends all the experiment metadata to the Neptune app.
It requires the `neptune-contrib <https://neptune-contrib.readthedocs.io/index.html/>`_ package to be installed.
You can install it by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install neptune-contrib

Adding a Neptune Observer
-------------------------

NeptuneObserver can only be added from the Python code.
You simply need to initialize it with your project name and (optionally) api token.

.. code-block:: python

    from neptunecontrib.monitoring.sacred import NeptuneObserver
    ex.observers.append(NeptuneObserver(api_token='YOUR_API_TOKEN',
                                        project_name='USER_NAME/PROJECT_NAME'))

.. warning::

    Always keep your API token secret - it is like password to the application.
    It is recommended to pass your token via the environment variable `NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN`.
    To make things simple you can put `export NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN=YOUR_LONG_API_TOKEN`
    line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` files.

Events
======
A ``started_event`` is fired when a run starts.
Then every 10 seconds while the experiment is running a ``heatbeat_event`` is
fired.
Whenever a resource or artifact is added to the running experiment a
``resource_event`` resp. ``artifact_event`` is fired.
Finally, once it stops one of the three ``completed_event``,
``interrupted_event``, or ``failed_event`` is fired.
If the run is only being queued, then instead of all the above only a single
``queued_event`` is fired.


.. _event_started:

Start
-----
The moment an experiment is started, the first event is fired for all the
observers. It contains the following information:

    ===========  ===============================================================
    ex_info      Some information about the experiment:

                    * the docstring of the experiment-file
                    * filename and md5 hash for all source-dependencies of the experiment
                    * names and versions of packages the experiment depends on
    command      The name of the command that was run.
    host_info    Some information about the machine it's being run on:

                    * CPU name
                    * number of CPUs
                    * hostname
                    * Operating System
                    * Python version
                    * Python compiler
    start_time   The date/time it was started
    config       The configuration for this run, including the root-seed.
    meta_info    Meta-information about this run such as a custom comment
                 and the priority of this run.
    _id          The ID of this run, as determined by the first observer
    ===========  ===============================================================

The started event is also the time when the ID of the run is determined.
Essentially the first observer which sees `_id=None` sets an id and returns it.
That id is then stored in the run and also passed to all further observers.

.. _event_queued:

Queued
------
If a run is only queued instead of being run (see :ref:`cmdline_queue`), then this event is fired instead
of a ``started_event``. It contains the same information as the
``started_event`` except for the ``host_info``.


.. _heartbeat:

Heartbeat
---------
While the experiment is running, every 10 seconds a Heartbeat event is fired.
It updates the **captured stdout and stderr** of the experiment, the custom
``info`` (see below), and the current result. The heartbeat event is also a
way of monitoring if an experiment is still running.


Stop
----
Sacred distinguishes three ways in which an experiment can end:

Successful Completion:
    If an experiment finishes without an error, a ``completed_event`` is fired,
    which contains the time it completed and the result the command returned.

Interrupted:
    If a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` exception occurs (most of time this means you
    cancelled the experiment manually) instead an ``interrupted_event`` is fired,
    which only contains the interrupt time.

Failed:
    In case any other exception occurs, Sacred fires a ``failed_event`` with the
    fail time and the corresponding stacktrace.


Resources
---------
Every time :py:meth:`sacred.Experiment.open_resource` is called with a
filename, an event will be fired with that filename (see :ref:`resources`).

Artifacts
---------
Every time :py:meth:`sacred.Experiment.add_artifact` is called with a filename
and optionally a name, an event will be fired with that name and filename
(see :ref:`artifacts`). If the name is left empty it defaults to the filename.


.. _custom_info:

Saving Custom Information
=========================
Sometimes you want to add custom information about the run of an experiment,
like the dataset, error curves during training, or the final trained model.
To allow this sacred offers three different mechanisms.


.. _info_dict:

Info Dict
---------
The ``info`` dictionary is meant to store small amounts of information about
the experiment, like training loss for each epoch or the total number of
parameters. It is updated on each heartbeat, such that its content is
accessible in the database already during runtime.

To store information in the ``info`` dict it can be accessed via ``ex.info``,
but only while the experiment is *running*.
Another way is to access it directly through the run with ``_run.info``.
This can be done conveniently using the special ``_run`` parameter in any
captured function, which gives you access to the current ``Run`` object.

You can add whatever information you like to ``_run.info``. This ``info`` dict
will be sent to all the observers every 10 sec as part of the
:ref:`heartbeat_event <heartbeat>`.

.. warning::
    Many observers will convert the information of ``info`` into JSON using the
    jsonpickle library. This works for most python datatypes, but the resulting
    entries in the database may look different from what you might expect.
    So only store non-JSON information if you absolutely need to.

If the info dict contains ``numpy`` arrays or ``pandas`` Series/DataFrame/Panel
then these will be converted to json automatically. The result is human
readable (nested lists for ``numpy`` and a dict for ``pandas``), but might be
imprecise in some cases.


.. _resources:

Resources
---------
Generally speaking a resource is a file that your experiment needs to read
during a run. When you open a file using  ``ex.open_resource(filename)`` then
a ``resource_event`` will be fired and the MongoObserver will check whether
that file is in the database already. If not it will store it there.
In any case the filename along with its MD5 hash is logged.

.. _artifacts:

Artifacts
---------
An artifact is a file created during the run. This mechanism is meant to store
big custom chunks of data like a trained model. With
:py:meth:`sacred.Experiment.add_artifact` such a file can be added, which will fire an
``artifact_event``. The MongoObserver will then in turn again, store that file
in the database and log it in the run entry.
Artifacts always have a name, but if the optional name parameter is left empty
it defaults to the filename.


.. _custom_observer:

Custom Observer
===============

The easiest way to implement a custom observer is to inherit from
:py:class:`sacred.observers.RunObserver` and override some or all of the events:

.. code-block:: python

    from sacred.observer import RunObserver

    class MyObserver(RunObserver):
        def queued_event(self, ex_info, command, queue_time, config, meta_info,
                         _id):
            pass

        def started_event(self, ex_info, command, host_info, start_time,
                          config, meta_info, _id):
            pass

        def heartbeat_event(self, info, captured_out, beat_time, result):
            pass

        def completed_event(self, stop_time, result):
            pass

        def interrupted_event(self, interrupt_time, status):
            pass

        def failed_event(self, fail_time, fail_trace):
            pass

        def resource_event(self, filename):
            pass

        def artifact_event(self, name, filename):
            pass
