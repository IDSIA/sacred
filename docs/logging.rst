Logging
*******
Sacred used the python `logging <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html>`_
module to log some basic information about the execution. It also makes it easy
for you to integrate that logging with your code.

.. _log_levels:

Adjusting Log-Levels from command line
======================================
If you run the hello_world example you will see the following output::

    >> python hello_world.py
    INFO - hello_world - Running command 'main'
    INFO - hello_world - Started
    Hello world!
    INFO - hello_world - Completed after 0:00:00

The lines starting with ``INFO`` are logging outputs. They can be suppressed by
adjusting the loglevel. This can be done via the command-line like with the
``--loglevel`` (``-l`` for short) option::

    >> python hello_world -l ERROR
    Hello world!

The specified level can be either a string or an integer:

+----------+---------------+
| Level    | Numeric value |
+==========+===============+
| CRITICAL | 50            |
+----------+---------------+
| ERROR    | 40            |
+----------+---------------+
| WARNING  | 30            |
+----------+---------------+
| INFO     | 20            |
+----------+---------------+
| DEBUG    | 10            |
+----------+---------------+
| NOTSET   | 0             |
+----------+---------------+

Adjusting Log-Levels from python
================================

If you prefer, you can also adjust the logging level from python when
running an experiment by passing the long version of the log level
command line parameter as an option, as follows:

.. code-block:: python
    
    ex.run(options={'--loglevel': 'ERROR'})

Note that this can only be done when using ``Experiment.run``, not when using
``Experiment.main`` or ``Experiment.automain``.

Integrate Logging Into Your Experiment
======================================
If you want to make use of the logging mechanism for your own experiments the
easiest way is to use the special ``_log`` argument in your captured functions:

.. code-block:: python

    @ex.capture
    def some_function(_log):
        _log.warning('My warning message!')

This will by default print a line like this::

    WARNING - some_function - My warning message!

The ``_log`` is a standard
`Logger object <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logger-objects>`_
for your function, as a child logger of the experiments main logger.
So it allows calls to ``debug``, ``info``, ``warning``, ``error``, ``critical``
and some more. Check out the documentation to see what you can do with them.

Customize the Logger
====================
It is easy to customize the logging behaviour of your experiment by just
providing a custom
`Logger object <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logger-objects>`_
to your experiment:

.. code-block:: python

   import logging
   logger = logging.getLogger('my_custom_logger')
   ## configure your logger here
   ex.logger = logger

The custom logger will be used to generate all the loggers for all
captured functions. This way you can use all the features of the
`logging <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html>`_ package. See the
``examples/log_example.py`` file for an example of this.
